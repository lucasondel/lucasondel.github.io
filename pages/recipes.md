You can find here the recipes I use in my research. These recipes are
[Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebooks so they
can be run in a browser or directly as [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
scripts.

The code source of these recipes can be found on my
[SpeechLab](https://github.com/lucasondel/SpeechLab) github
repository.
