You can find here the recipes in my research. The recipes are
[Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebooks, i.e. they
can be run in a browser or directly as [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
scripts.

The code source of these recipes can be found on the
[SpeechLab](https://github.com/lucasondel/SpeechLab) github
repositories.
