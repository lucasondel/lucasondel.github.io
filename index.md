I am currently a Visiting Researcher at SONOS Paris where I work on
on-device ASR. I completed a Ph. D. at Brno University of Technology
under the supervision of doc. Ing. (Lukáš Burget)[https://www.fit.vut.cz/person/burget/.en]. My main interest lies in *universal* speech technologies,
that is technologies targeting all possible languages and usable by
everyone.

This is my personal website where you can check out my work. Feel free
to [contact me](mailto:lucas.ondel@gmail.com) if you are
interested in my research!
